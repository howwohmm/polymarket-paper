Polymarket COPYBOT — paper forward-test of mirroring vetted traders.

We can't backtest these traders (their bets are still open), so this forward-tests:
every time a tracked wallet BUYs, we record a paper copy at a fixed $2 notional within
each trader's own $20 bankroll at the price available, then track it. As markets
resolve we book realized P&L; open positions are marked to current price. ROI
(bankroll-independent) is the metric that matters.

Self-healing/idempotent: each tick re-reads recent trades and only inserts ones we
haven't copied yet (deduped by tx+asset), so missed/throttled runs lose nothing.

Tracked wallets were vetted for copyability: small clip ($5-15, a $2 copy can ride),
taker (not a maker/rebate farmer), diversified, slow/lag-tolerant markets.

Commands:
  python3 copybot.py tick          # detect tracked wallets' new buys, record paper copies
  python3 copybot.py resolve       # settle resolved copies; mark open ones to current price
  python3 copybot.py claude_decide # (model C) ask Claude whether moved positions are HOLD/SELL
  python3 copybot.py export        # rebuild docs/data.json + quality.json for the dashboard
  python3 copybot.py report        # realized + unrealized copy P&L, per model and total

Five models, each trader gets their own $20 bankroll per model:
  A hold | B exit +15%/36h | C Claude decides | D stop-loss+trailing | E chart-filtered entry + D exits
